#  Texas Gambling Taxes May Increase

As states continue to legalize gambling, they are also wrestling with how to tax it. In Texas, lawmakers are considering a proposal that would increase taxes on gambling winnings.

Currently, Texas taxes gambling winnings at a rate of 6.25%. The proposed bill would increase the tax rate to 8%. Lawmakers say the higher tax rate is needed to help offset the cost of legalizing gambling in the state.

Opponents of the bill say it will hurt the casinos and racetracks that operate in Texas. They argue that the increased tax rate will make it harder for these businesses to compete with casinos in other states.

Supporters of the bill say it will help ensure that the state benefits from legalized gambling. They argue that the higher tax rate is reasonable and will help ensure that everyone pays their fair share.

The bill is currently under consideration by lawmakers in Texas. It is not clear if it will pass or not, but the debate over taxation of gambling winnings is sure to continue.

#  Gambling taxes in Texas may increase

A proposal to increase gambling taxes in Texas is stirring up a lot of controversy. The proposed increase would raise taxes on casinos, racetracks and gaming devices from 6.25% to 8%.

Supporters of the measure say that it is needed in order to help support education in the state. They point to the fact that Texas ranks near the bottom when it comes to per pupil spending. Opponents of the measure, however, say that it will drive businesses out of the state and cost jobs.

Texas is one of only seven states that does not have a state lottery. This means that there is relatively little gambling taxation in the state. The proposed increase would make Texas more inline with other states when it comes to gambling taxes.

Casinos and racetracks in Texas are currently taxed at a rate of 6.25%. This is lower than in other states such as New York (43%), Illinois (31%) and Nevada (9%). Gaming devices are taxed at a rate of 25%, which is also lower than in other states.

The proposed increase would bring Texas’s casino tax rate up to 8%, which would be higher than in New York, Illinois and Nevada. The racetrack tax rate would go from 6.25% to 7%, while the gaming device tax rate would stay at 25%.

Governor Abbott has not yet taken a position on the proposal, but he is likely to face pressure from both sides on this issue.

#  Texas lawmakers discuss potential gambling tax increase

Texas lawmakers are considering a potential increase to the state’s gambling tax as a way to help offset the budget shortfall.

The proposed increase would see the tax raised from 6.25% to 17.5%, which is in line with what other states charge. Supporters of the increase say it would bring in an additional $100 million in revenue each year.

Opponents of the measure, however, say that it would lead to job losses and casino closures, resulting in a net loss of revenue for the state. They also argue that it would not be enough to address the budget shortfall, which is estimated at around $27 billion.

A vote on the proposed tax increase is expected to take place in early 2019.

#  Potential gambling tax increase in Texas

Texas lawmakers are considering a potential gambling tax increase in the state. Senate Bill 939, filed by Republican state Senator Lois Kolkhorst, seeks to add an additional 10 percent tax on casinos and racetracks.

The proposed tax increase would generate an estimated $72 million in revenue for the state each year. The money would be used to help fund education and other services, according to Kolkhorst.

Opponents of the bill say that it will hurt the state's gambling industry and could lead to job losses. However, supporters argue that the extra revenue is needed to help fund important programs in the state.

The bill is currently under consideration by the Texas Legislature.

#  Texas may see a gambling tax increase

A recent report from the National Gambling Impact Study Commission suggests that Texas may see a gambling tax increase as state lawmakers look to bolster revenue. The proposal would add a new tax of 17% on adjusted gross revenues generated by casinos and other forms of legal gambling in the state.

The measure is expected to generate an additional $166 million in annual revenue for state coffers, with much of that earmarked for education. Lawmakers are hopeful that the increased revenue will help offset some of the budgetary shortfalls brought on by the oil price decline.

Gambling is currently taxed at 6% in Texas, making it one of the lowest-taxed states in the country. Neighboring New Mexico has a rate of 25%, while Oklahoma charges 27%. Louisiana levies a 34% tax on gambling revenues.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has not yet taken a public position on the proposed tax hike, but legislators expect some resistance from the governor’s office. A similar measure was proposed during the most recent legislative session, but it failed to gain traction due to opposition from within Abbott’s own party.
