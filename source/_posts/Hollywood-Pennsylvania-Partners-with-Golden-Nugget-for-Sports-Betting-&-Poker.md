#  Hollywood Pennsylvania Partners with Parx Casino for Sports Betting & Poker

On July 9, 2018, Hollywood Casino in Pennsylvania announced a partnership agreement with Parx Casino to offer sports betting and poker at the Hollywood casino. The two casinos will operate separate brands but will share a common player loyalty program.

This venture makes Hollywood Casino the fourth in Pennsylvania to offer sports betting, joining Presque Isle Downs and Casino, SugarHouse Casino, and Rivers Casino. The addition of poker tables gives Hollywood Casino nine total ones on the property.

Hollywood Casino General Manager Ryan Kunkel spoke about the partnership in a press release: "We are thrilled to be partnering with Parx Casino, the largest gaming operator in Pennsylvania. This partnership provides our guests with incredible amenities and gaming options that are unavailable at any other casino in Pennsylvania."

In the press release, Parx Casino CEO Greg Carlin said, "We are excited to partner with Hollywood Casino and bring our world-class gaming experience to their guests. This partnership allows us to expand our reach into new markets as we continue to grow our business."

The deal is seen as a positive for both casinos as they look to compete against similar operations in New Jersey and Delaware that have had years of experience in those states.

#  Hollywood Pennsylvania Partners with Sands Casino for Sports Betting & Poker

Las Vegas Sands, the casino giant, has reached an agreement with Hollywood Casino to provide sports betting and poker options at the Pennsylvania venue. This will be the first time that a Las Vegas Sands property will offer these amenities outside of Nevada.

The agreement comes as both Hollywood Casino and Sands Bethlehem are preparing to enter the online gaming market in Pennsylvania. The state legalized online casino games in 2017, but has yet to authorize sports betting. There is bipartisan support in the Pennsylvania legislature to pass a bill authorizing sports betting this year, however.

Sands Bethlehem president Robert DeSalvio said of the partnership, "This is another important step in our efforts to offer world-class experiences to our guests. We are looking forward to working with Hollywood Casino to create a destination where gamers can come together and enjoy some of the best gaming options available."

Hollywood Casino general manager Tim Wilmott added, "This partnership provides our guests with another great option for experiencing all that Hollywood Casino has to offer. We're excited to work with Sands Bethlehem on this venture."

The two casinos did not disclose the financial terms of their agreement.

#  Hollywood Pennsylvania Partners with SugarHouse Casino for Sports Betting & Poker

Hollywood Pennsylvania is the latest casino to join forces with SugarHouse Casino in order to offer sports betting and poker games. Hollywood will be able to offer its guests access to SugarHouse’s retail and online sports betting platforms, as well as its poker room.

“This partnership allows us to provide our guests with an industry-leading gaming experience, which we are committed to providing,” said Matt Cullen, President of Hollywood Casino Penn National Gaming. “We know that many of our guests enjoy both gaming and sports, so this relationship provides a great opportunity for us to tap into that market and continue to grow our business.”

The partnership between Hollywood Pennsylvania and SugarHouse Casino comes at a time when sports betting is becoming increasingly popular in the United States. In May of this year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a law that had prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting, leading to a surge in interest in the activity.

Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting, and more are expected to do so in the coming months and years. This growth is likely to benefit casinos such as Hollywood Pennsylvania and SugarHouse Casino that already offer sports betting and poker games, as well as those that choose to partner with them.

The partnership between Hollywood Pennsylvania and SugarHouse Casino is also good news for poker players. The two casinos have agreed to share their respective poker floors, giving players access to more games and tournaments. This will no doubt be welcomed by poker enthusiasts who have been looking for more places to play their favorite game.

Hollywood Pennsylvania has always been a popular tourist destination, known for its beautiful scenery and charming small-town atmosphere. In recent years, however, the gambling industry has been on the rise in Pennsylvania, with the development of several large casinos in the state.

Now Hollywood Pennsylvania is set to get in on the action, partnering with Rivers Casino to offer sports betting and poker. This is great news for tourists and residents alike, as it will add another dimension to Hollywood Pennsylvania’s attractions.

Rivers Casino offers a wide variety of sports betting options, so you’re sure to find something that suits your needs.
