#  How to Choose the Top 30% of Hands in Poker 

As any experienced poker player knows, hands played out of position are typically more difficult and result in a smaller profit when won when compared to hands played in position. Position is so important in poker that many experts suggest only playing the top 30% of hands when out of position. This article will teach you how to quickly determine which hands are in the top 30% and give you some tips on how to play them.

There is no magic equation to figure out which hands are in the top 30%. Some factors that should be considered when making this decision are your opponents’ tendencies, stack sizes, and table dynamics. However, there are a few guidelines that can help you make this determination. 

The first guideline is to always play premium hands (aces and kings) in position. These hands have a high chance of winning and should be played every time they are dealt. When playing these premium hands out of position, however, you will want to be extra cautious and only enter into pots if the odds are in your favor. 

Another guideline is to avoid small pairs (2s through 4s) and suited connectors (6s through 10s). These hands rarely win big pots and can often be beaten by better hands. Additionally, they tend to be weaker than other hands that can be played at showdown. 

The third guideline is to pay close attention to the players at the table. If your opponents are loose and aggressive, then it may be beneficial to play more marginal hands. On the other hand, if your opponents are tight and passive, then you will want to stick with playing only strong hands. 

Now that we have covered some of the basic guidelines for choosing which hands to play out of position, let’s take a look at some specific examples. 

Say you are playing against four opponents – two tight players and two loose players. You would want to play more marginal hands against the loose players since they are likely to call with weaker holdings. Against the tight players, however, you would want to stick with playing only strong starting hands like aces and kings. 

If you are playing at a table with several short-stacked players, then it may be advantageous to play weaker starting hands since they have a better chance of hitting something big when combined with multiple cards from the flop or turn. Conversely, if there are several deep-stacked players at the table, then it would make sense to stick with playing only premium hands since they have a higher percentage chance of winning without having to see too many cards come community cards later on in the hand. 

While there is no one perfect formula for choosing which hands fall into the top 30%, using these general guidelines should help improve your results when played out of position.

#  How to Play the Top 30% of Hands in Poker 

In poker, if you want to make money in the long run, you have to play tight. By playing tight, we mean playing the top 30% of hands. By playing only the top 30% of hands, you will ensure that your opponents are not able to take advantage of you.

The best way to play the top 30% of hands is by using a starting hand chart. A starting hand chart is a list of hands that tells you which hands to play and which hands to fold. The following is a list of the most common starting hand charts:

1) Basic Strategy Chart
2) 8/9 Seated Game Chart
3) 4/5 Seated Game Chart
4) Heads Up (1 on 1) Chart
5) 6 Max No Limit Texas Holdem Chart


#  What the Top 30% of Hands in Poker Mean for You 

The top 30% of hands in poker are statistically the most powerful, and as such will give you the best chance to win in any given situation.

But what do these hands actually mean for your game? And how can you use them to your advantage?

Here’s a look at the top 30% of hands, and what you need to know about each one:

#1. AA

AA is the strongest hand in poker, and as such should always be played aggressively. If you can get all-in preflop, go for it! Otherwise, try to build a pot with your big pairs by betting and raising liberally.

#2. KK

KK is another incredibly powerful hand, and should be played in a similar way to AA. Remember that getting all-in preflop is often your best option with these two hands; after all, you’re virtually guaranteed to win the pot if your opponents don’t have a pair themselves.

#3. QQ

QQ is still a very strong hand, but doesn’t quite have the power of AA or KK. Still, it’s worth playing aggressively with this hand – especially if there are several players still in the pot. Be prepared to fold if someone raises big enough though; there’s no point hanging on to QQ if there’s a good chance you’ll lose the majority of your chips.

#4. JJ

JJ is another great hand that should be played aggressively preflop. Like QQ, it may not be quite as powerful as AA or KK, but it’s still worth betting and raising with when you have the opportunity. And remember – never slow down just because you have a pair of jacks! There are plenty of ways to win pots without hitting a straight or flush.

#  Playing the Top 30% of Hands in Poker for Success 

In any poker game, the vast majority of hands will not result in a win for either player. In order to increase your chances of winning, it's important to focus on playing the top 30% of hands.

As a general rule, you should only play hands that have at least a pair or better. This strategy will help you to avoid getting into difficult situations where you're likely to lose money.

If you're playing in a cash game, it's also important to remember that the table will tighten up as the stakes increase. This means that you'll need to be even more selective with the hands you play as the blinds get higher.

By playing the top 30% of hands, you'll give yourself the best chance of winning money in any poker game.
