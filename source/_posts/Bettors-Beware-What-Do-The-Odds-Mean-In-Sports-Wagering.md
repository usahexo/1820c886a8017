#  Bettors Beware: What Do The Odds Mean In Sports Wagering?

For the average person who bets on sports, it can be confusing trying to understand what the odds mean. In this article, we will break down the odds for you and explain how they work.

The most common type of sports wager is the point spread. The point spread is a margin of victory set by the bookmaker that players bet on. When you see Denver -7 at Carolina, that means Denver is expected to beat Carolina by 7 points. If you wager on Denver, they must win by more than 7 points for you to win your bet. If Carolina were to upset Denver, then Carolina would be covering the point spread and those who wagered on them would win their bets.

When looking at the odds for a game, there are three things you need to know:
-The favorite (the team expected to win)
-The underdog (the team not expected to win)
-The line (the margin of victory Vegas thinks will happen)

In our example, Denver is the favorite with a line of -7 and Carolina is the underdog with a line of +7. This doesn’t mean that Carolina can’t or won’t win, it just means that Vegas thinks it will be an upset if they do.

Another common type of sports wager is the moneyline bet. A moneyline bet is simply betting on which team will win straight up - no points involved. So in our example, if you wanted to bet on Carolina Moneyline, they would have to outright win the game for you to collect your payout. Conversely, if you wanted to bet on Denver Moneyline, they would have to lose for you to collect your payout. Moneylines are typically presented as either a positive or negative number. For instance, DEN -240 means that Denver is favored and you would have to risk $240 in order to win $100 if they cover the spread. Whereas CAR +200 means that Carolina is an underdog and if they upset Denver, then you would collect $200 for every $100 risked.

It’s important when looking at moneylines to pay attention to which team is favored and which team is an underdog as this will usually dictate how big of a payoff you can receive if your pick wins.

Lastly, there are also over/under bets which are simply wagers on how many total points will be scored in a game. You can either choose whether you think there will be more or less than the set number or stay away from this type of bet altogether. In our example above, if you think 48 points or less will be scored in total, then you would wager UNDER 48 points; whereas if you think 49 or more points will be scored in total, then you would wager OVER 49 points.

#  Iowa State Cyclones Facing A Tough Challenge Against Oklahoma Sooners 

After starting the season 3-0, the Iowa State Cyclones now face a tall task as they travel to Norman to take on the Oklahoma Sooners.

The Sooners are coming off a 49-31 win over Baylor and have looked like one of the top teams in the country so far this year. Quarterback Kyler Murray has been impressive, throwing for 1,161 yards and 12 touchdowns while also rushing for 354 yards and four touchdowns.

Iowa State will need to play their best game of the year if they want to have a chance against Oklahoma. The Cyclones have shown that they can compete with anyone, but they will need to play mistake-free football if they want to come away with a win.

Some of the key players for Iowa State include quarterback Brock Purdy, running back David Montgomery, and receiver Hakeem Butler. Montgomery is one of the best running backs in the country and will be a challenge for Oklahoma’s defense. Butler is one of the most explosive receivers in the country and has already caught touchdown passes of 73 and 97 yards this season.

The Sooners are favored to win this game, but don’t count out Iowa State. They have already shown that they can compete with anyone and could pull off an upset on Saturday night.

#  Understanding How Point Spreads Work In College Football Wagering 

When betting college football, one of the first decisions that you have to make is whether to bet the point spread or the money line. For those who are not familiar with these two types of bets, the point spread is the number of points that a team is favored by. The money line is how much money you would need to wager in order to win $100.

Let's take a look at an example. The Alabama Crimson Tide are playing the Vanderbilt Commodores. According to most sportsbooks, Alabama is a 16-point favorite. This means that if you bet on Alabama -16, they would need to win by more than 16 points for you to win your bet. If Vanderbilt were to pull off the upset, then a bet on them would pay out at +16.

Now let's take a look at the money line for this game. The odds on Alabama are -1200 and +650 for Vanderbilt. This means that if you wager $1200 on Alabama, you would win $100. If you wager $100 on Vanderbilt, then you would win $650.

So which should you choose? The point spread or the money line? This really depends on how confident you are in your pick. If you think Alabama will easily win by more than 16 points, then the point spread is probably your best option. However, if you think there is a good chance that Vanderbilt could pull off the upset, then betting them on the money line may be a better option.

#  College Basketball Gambling Advice: What To Look For In Opening Lines

The college basketball season tips off this week and that means it’s time for some gambling! Wagering on the NCAA is always a fun way to make the games a little more exciting, but it can also be profitable if you know what to look for when betting the lines.

One of the most important things to remember when betting on college hoops is that the opening line is not always an accurate reflection of which team will win the game. In fact, sometimes the line can be way off and provide some great value for a contrarian bet. With that in mind, let’s take a look at three factors to consider when looking at opening lines:

Public Perception

One of the biggest things that linesmakers take into account when setting a spread is public perception. They want to make sure that the majority of people are betting one side so that they can make money on the other side. As a result, you can often find some good value by betting against the public consensus.

For example, let’s say that Duke is playing North Carolina State. The Blue Devils are heavily favored in the opening line, but most people believe that NC State has a chance to pull off the upset. If you believe that too and are willing to take on some extra risk, then you could potentially make some money by betting on NC State.

Injuries/Depth Charts

Injuries and depth charts are another thing to pay attention to when looking at opening lines. Often times, teams who are missing key players or have inexperienced backups will be undervalued by the bookmakers. This presents an opportunity to bet on those teams in order to get better odds.

For example, let’s say that Oklahoma is playing Texas Tech. The Sooners are missing their best player due to injury, while the Red Raiders have a deep roster full of experienced players. In this case, Texas Tech would be undervalued by the bookmakers and would be worth considering as an underdog bet.

Recent History

Finally, it’s always important to keep recent history in mind when looking at opening lines. Certain teams have a tendency to play up or down to their competition, so it’s important to know which team is in good form heading into a matchup.

For example, let’s say that Michigan State is playing Bucknell. The Spartans are coming into this game riding high after winning the National Championship last year, while Bucknell has never made it past the first round of the tournament. In this case, Michigan State would be heavily favored and not worth betting on given their recent history of dominance against inferior opponents
