#  What is MED-IVee?

MED-IVee is a medical device that helps improve the intravenous (IV) infusion process. The device consists of an adapter that attaches to an IV bag and a tube that inserts into the vein. When the MED-IVee adapter is attached to an IV bag, it opens up a small port on the top of the bag. This port allows for air to escape and prevents the formation of bubbles in the IV fluid. The MED-IVee tube has a small hole at the end, which helps to insert the tube into the vein with less difficulty.

The MED-IVee device was designed by two engineers, Brett Esslinger and Andrew Olszewski. Both Brett and Andrew have experience in medical device design and felt that there was a need for a better way to deliver IV fluids. They teamed up with Dan Fleischhacker, an experienced nurse, to help them develop a product that would make it easier for nurses to insert IV tubes into veins.

The MED-IVee team participated in the Shark Tank television show in 2016 and secured a investment from one of the sharks, Kevin Harrington. Since then, they have been working hard to get their product into hospitals and clinics across the country.

The MED-IVee device is made in the USA and has received FDA approval.

#  What does MED-IVee provide for patients? 

The MED-IVee provides patients with four treatments: 

1. A blood draw to check the patient's blood chemistries and complete a CBC.
2. Iv fluids, including saline and potassium, to help the patient feel better and increase their hydration levels.
3. Pharmacologic management, including antibiotics and other medications as needed.
4. Education on self-care post discharge.

#  How does MED-IVee work to provide solutions for patients? 

 ## Introduction
MED-IVee is a medical device that has been designed to improve the way that intravenous fluids are delivered to patients. The device is composed of two parts: a controller and an adapter. The controller is placed into a hospital's information system, while the adapter is attached to the patient's intravenous line.

The controller monitors the patient's fluid intake and output, as well as other vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure. When it detects that the patient is in danger of dehydration or overhydration, it sends an alert to the hospital's staff. This allows them to intervene before any serious health complications occur.

The adapter is made of flexible silicone, which makes it more comfortable for the patient than traditional intravenous lines. It also features a locking mechanism that prevents it from being accidentally removed from the patient's arm.

## How MED-IVee improves patient care 
There are several ways in which MED-IVee can improve patient care. First, by monitoring the patient's fluid intake and output, the device can help to prevent dehydration and overhydration. This not only helps to safeguard the patient's health, but also reduces the risk of hospital admissions and readmissions.

Second, MED-IVee allows hospital staff to track a patient's vital signs in real time. This helps them to identify any potential health problems early on, so that they can be treated quickly and effectively.

Lastly, MED-IVee makes it easier for nurses to administer intravenous fluids to patients. The flexible silicone adapter is more comfortable than traditional intravenous lines, and the locking mechanism prevents it from being accidentally removed from the arm.

#  Who are the target patients of MED-IVee? 

Patients who are chronically ill and need intravenous treatments to manage their condition are the target patients of MED-IVee. This system is designed for those who need regular or ongoing treatments, such as chemotherapy or antibiotics, and who would benefit from the convenience and reduced cost of home care.

Many chronically ill patients struggle with the daily challenge of getting to a doctor's office or hospital for treatment. MED-IVee helps to reduce this burden, by providing a mobile unit that can be delivered directly to the patient's home. This allows them to receive treatment in a comfortable and familiar environment, which can often lead to better outcomes.

The team at MED-IVee is dedicated to helping chronically ill patients regain their independence and improve their quality of life. If you or someone you know could benefit from our services, please contact us today.

#  What are some potential benefits that patients could experience from using MED-IVee?

The potential benefits that patients could experience from using MED-IVee include: receiving necessary medications and treatments more quickly, experiencing improved comfort levels, and having a shorter hospital stay.

With MED-IVee, patients can receive their necessary medications and treatments more quickly. This is because MED-IVee delivers medications and treatments directly to the patientâ€™s bloodstream, which eliminates the need for time-consuming and potentially error-prone procedures such as oral ingestion or IV insertion.

MED-IVee also results in improved comfort levels for patients. This is because MED-IVee does not require needle sticks or catheterization, both of which can be distressing and painful procedures. Additionally, with less equipment required for treatment, patients have less opportunity to contract infections.

Finally, thanks to the faster treatments delivered by MED-IVee, patients often have a shorter hospital stay. In some cases, patients have even been able to return home on the same day that they received their treatment through MED-IVee.
