# How to Figure Payback Return on a Slot Machine

Slot machines are one of the most popular games in a casino, with many players hoping to hit the jackpot and win big. However, it's important to understand how the payback return works, as this can greatly affect your overall winnings.

Payback return refers to the percentage of money that a slot machine will pay back over a period of time. For example, if a machine has a payback of 95%, this means that over time, it will pay back 95 cents for every dollar that is wagered. The remaining 5 cents will go to the casino as profit.

Calculating payback return can be a bit tricky, but there are a few steps you can follow to figure it out.

## Step 1: Find the Machine's RTP

The first step is to find out the machine's Return to Player (RTP) percentage. This can usually be found in the game's rules or help section. The RTP is the percentage of all the wagered money that a slot machine will pay back to players over time. 

For example, if a machine has an RTP of 95%, it means that the machine will pay back 95 cents for every dollar that is wagered over a long period of time.

## Step 2: Determine the House Edge

The next step is to determine the house edge. The house edge is the percentage of money that the casino expects to keep over time. To calculate the house edge, you subtract the RTP from 100%.

For example, if a machine has an RTP of 95%, the house edge would be 5%.

## Step 3: Calculate the Payback Return

Once you know the RTP and house edge, you can calculate the payback return. To do this, you need to take the amount of money you expect to win and divide it by the amount of money you expect to wager. Then, multiply that number by 100 to get a percentage.

For example, if you plan to wager $100 and the machine has an RTP of 95%, you can expect to win $95. If you divide $95 by $100, you get 0.95. Multiply that by 100, and you get a payback return of 95%.

It's important to note that payback return is calculated over a long period of time and is not a guarantee of how much you will win or lose in a single session. However, understanding payback return can help you make informed decisions about which machines to play and how much to wager.

In conclusion, figuring out the payback return on a slot machine can help you maximize your winnings and make more informed gambling decisions. By following these steps, you can determine the machine's RTP, calculate the house edge, and calculate the payback return.
