The poker room at the Spokane Tribe Casino is one of the nicer ones that I have been to. They have plenty of tables and usually several games running. The dealers are friendly and know what they are doing. The waitresses keep the drinks flowing and there is even a snack bar for players looking for a quick bite to eat.

The casino also has a nice hotel attached to it. The spa is wonderful, especially after a long day at the casino. The restaurants are all good as well, but my favorite is the buffet. They have every type of food imaginable and it is all delicious! And if you're looking for some nightlife, the casino has that too!
