#  Emerald Gold Game offers biggest payouts in Fallout New Vegas

If you're looking for a high-stakes gambling game with the potential for some of the biggest payouts in Fallout New Vegas, look no further than Emerald Gold. This game can be found in The Tops casino, and features a high-risk, high-reward betting system.

In order to play Emerald Gold, you'll need at least 1000 caps. The minimum bet is 100 caps, so if you want to bet less than that you'll need to find another game. The maximum bet is 1000 caps, so if you've got the cash to spare this is the perfect game for you.

The goal of Emerald Gold is simple: Bet on either red or black, and hope that your number comes up when the dealer flips the card. If it does, you'll win double your bet amount! So, if you put down 200 caps on black and it comes up black, you'll walk away with 400 caps instead.

However, there's a catch: The house always has an edge, no matter what your prediction is. So while there is potential for some big payouts, there's also the risk of losing everything you've put down. If you're feeling lucky (or brave), then give Emerald Gold a try and see if you can strike it rich!
