        <h1 id="Illinois-Lottery-Commission-to-Regulate-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Illinois-Lottery-Commission-to-Regulate-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Illinois Lottery Commission to Regulate Sports Betting"></a>Illinois Lottery Commission to Regulate Sports Betting</h1><p>The Illinois Lottery Commission will be regulating sports betting in the state, following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn a ban on the practice. The Commission plans to have rules in place by the start of the NFL season in September.</p>
<p>Lottery officials say they want to make sure that sports betting is “done right,” and that there is consumer protection in place. They also want to ensure that taxes are collected on bets made within Illinois.</p>
<p>The NFL and other professional sports leagues had fought to keep sports betting illegal, fearing that it would damage the integrity of their games. But the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could not regulate gambling under the unconstitutional 10th Amendment.</p>
<p>Many states have already taken steps to legalize sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court decision, including New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, and Rhode Island. In Pennsylvania, lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>Illinois is one of several states that have moved quickly to pass legislation authorizing sports betting in light of the Supreme Court ruling. Last week, Governor Bruce Rauner signed a bill allowing for both land-based and online sports betting in Illinois. The new law takes effect on July 1st.</p>
<p>There is already some opposition to the move in Illinois, with some lawmakers saying that it will lead to increased gambling addiction problems. But supporters say that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state budget.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-Attorney-General-to-Overseer-of-Sports-Betting-Regulations"><a href="#Illinois-Attorney-General-to-Overseer-of-Sports-Betting-Regulations" class="headerlink" title="Illinois Attorney General to Overseer of Sports Betting Regulations"></a>Illinois Attorney General to Overseer of Sports Betting Regulations</h1><p>The Illinois Attorney General will be overseeing the new sports betting regulations. The regulations were approved by the state’s gaming board on Wednesday. Sports betting can now take place at the state’s 10 licensed casinos and at horseracing tracks.</p>
<p>The Board voted unanimously in favor of the regulations, which were drawn up by staff. The rules spell out how bets will be accepted, taxed, and paid out. The Attorney General will have authority to investigate any potential violations of the new regulations.</p>
<p>The Board also approved regulations for fantasy sports betting. Operators of fantasy sports contests must now be licensed by the state and players must be at least 18 years old. There are limits on how much money can be wagered on each contest and operators must pay a $10,000 licensing fee.</p>
<p>State officials estimate that sports betting could generate as much as $36 million in taxes a year. They also anticipate that it will create hundreds of new jobs in the casino industry.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-Legislature-Passes-Bill-Regulating-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Illinois-Legislature-Passes-Bill-Regulating-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Illinois Legislature Passes Bill Regulating Sports Betting"></a>Illinois Legislature Passes Bill Regulating Sports Betting</h1><p>In a unanimous vote on May 31, the Illinois state legislature passed a bill that will legalize and regulate sports betting in the state. The bill will now be sent to Governor J.B. Pritzker for his signature.</p>
<p>Illinois is the latest state to legalize sports betting, following New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The new law in Illinois would allow for both online and land-based sports betting, with licenses being granted to casinos, racetracks, and other qualified operators.</p>
<p>The bill specifically prohibits betting on college sporting events taking place in Illinois, but does allow for bets on professional sporting events taking place elsewhere. Bettors would also be able to make parlay bets (a bet that combines two or more individual wagers) and prop bets (a wager on an event within a match).</p>
<p>Governor Pritzker has said that he plans to sign the bill into law. Once it goes into effect, Illinois will become the sixth state with legal sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Governor-of-Illinois-Signs-Bill-Regulating-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Governor-of-Illinois-Signs-Bill-Regulating-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Governor of Illinois Signs Bill Regulating Sports Betting"></a>Governor of Illinois Signs Bill Regulating Sports Betting</h1><p>The Governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, has today signed a bill regulating sports betting in the state. The new law will allow for sports betting at licensed casinos, with the Illinois Gaming Board responsible for regulating and overseeing the industry.</p>
<p>The law is seen as a way to generate additional revenue for the state, with officials estimating that sports betting could bring in as much as $200 million per year. Casino operators are also expected to benefit, with some predicting that the market for sports betting could be worth up to $1 billion annually.</p>
<p>Opposition to the bill was limited, with most criticism coming from religious groups who argue that gambling is morally wrong. However, proponents of the law argue that it will help to create jobs and boost the economy, and that it will provide a safe and regulated environment for people to bet on sports.</p>
<p>Sports betting has been illegal in Illinois since 1976, but the new law allows for it to take place at licensed casinos. Bettors will be able to place bets on games both within and outside of the state, and online gambling will also be allowed.</p>
<p>It is unclear how soon sports betting will be available in Illinois, but casino operators are expected to start offering it as soon as possible.</p>
<h1 id="New-Law-Regulating-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Goes-into-Effect"><a href="#New-Law-Regulating-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Goes-into-Effect" class="headerlink" title="New Law Regulating Sports Betting in Illinois Goes into Effect"></a>New Law Regulating Sports Betting in Illinois Goes into Effect</h1><p>On Jan. 1, a new law regulating sports betting in Illinois went into effect. The new law allows for licensed sports betting operators to offer bets on sporting events both in person and online.</p>
<p>The law is a response to the federal prohibition on sports betting, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in May 2018. In its ruling, the Supreme Court declared that the federal prohibition was unconstitutional, as it violated the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, which reserve powers to the states.</p>
<p>Illinois was one of several states that quickly moved to pass legislation regulating sports betting after the Supreme Court’s ruling. Other states that have passed similar laws include New Jersey, Delaware, and Mississippi.</p>
<p>Under the new Illinois law, sports betting operators must pay a licensing fee of $10 million and must also comply with a number of regulations, including age requirements and limits on how much money can be wagered per day.</p>
<p>Opponents of the law argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates and other negative consequences. However, supporters argue that legalization will bring much-needed revenue to the state government and will also create jobs in the sports betting industry.</p>
