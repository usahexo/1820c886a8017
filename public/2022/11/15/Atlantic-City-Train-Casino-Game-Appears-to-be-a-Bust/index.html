However, it appears that the new Revel Casino may have been a bust, as it is now being reported that the casino is losing money hand over fist.</p>
<p>The Revel Casino is not alone in its struggles; all of the casinos in Atlantic City are reporting significant losses. In fact, the Atlantic City casino industry as a whole lost $446 million last year. This is largely due to increased competition from casinos in other states, such as Pennsylvania and Maryland.</p>
<p>While it is too early to declare the Revel Casino a failure, things do not look good for it. If it does not turn around its fortunes soon, it may well join the ranks of other failed casinos in Atlantic City.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Transit-Rail-Casino-Game-Off-To-Rough-Start"><a href="#NJ-Transit-Rail-Casino-Game-Off-To-Rough-Start" class="headerlink" title="NJ Transit Rail Casino Game Off To Rough Start"></a>NJ Transit Rail Casino Game Off To Rough Start</h1><p>After much anticipation and buildup, the new NJ Transit casino game has gotten off to a rough start. Commuters report long delays, crowded platforms and rampant confusion as players attempt to figure out how the game works.</p>
<p>“It’s been a mess,” said one commuter. “People are pushing and shoving to get on the trains, and it’s just a total mess.”</p>
<p>NJ Transit officials are urging patience, saying that the game is still in its infancy and that there will be growing pains. In the meantime, they are advising commuters to take alternative forms of transportation if possible.</p>
<p>The new casino game was announced earlier this year as a way to help offset the budget shortfall at NJ Transit. The game works by allowing riders to bet on different outcomes of train trips, with the potential to win or lose money depending on the results.</p>
<p>Players can make bets on things like whether the train will be late, whether it will be full or whether it will make all its stops. The game has been met with mixed reactions, with some riders praising it as a fun way to pass the time, while others complain that it’s too complicated and takes up too much time.</p>
<p>So far, the biggest losers seem to be commuters who live in rail-dependent towns like Hoboken and Newark. These commuters are forced to take lengthy rail trips into Manhattan in order to make their bets, only to find out later that their trains were delayed or canceled.</p>
<p>NJ Transit officials insist that the game is still in beta testing and that they are working hard to resolve these issues. In the meantime, they are urging commuters to be patient and give the game a chance.</p>
<h1 id="Lack-of-Passengers-May-Doom-Atlantic-City-Train-Casino-Game"><a href="#Lack-of-Passengers-May-Doom-Atlantic-City-Train-Casino-Game" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Passengers May Doom Atlantic City Train Casino Game"></a>Lack of Passengers May Doom Atlantic City Train Casino Game</h1><p>In May, New Jersey Transit announced it would discontinue the casino train service between Atlantic City and Philadelphia due to a lack of passengers. The casino train offered a convenient way for gamblers to commute to and from the city, but now that the service is discontinued, some experts say this could spell doom for Atlantic City’s gaming industry.</p>
<p>The casino train was introduced in 2001 as a way to help revive Atlantic City’s gaming industry. At the time, gaming revenues were declining and the city was in debt. The casino train provided an easy way for people to get to and from the casinos, and it proved to be successful in boosting tourism.</p>
<p>However, over the past few years, revenues have been declining again and the casino train has seen a decline in ridership. In May, New Jersey Transit announced it would discontinue the service due to low ridership numbers. This could mean trouble for Atlantic City’s gaming industry, which already faces stiff competition from casinos in other states.</p>
<p>Experts say that without the convenience of the casino train, people may be less likely to travel to Atlantic City for gambling purposes. This could lead to a decline in tourism and revenue for the city’s casinos. Some experts even predict that the closure of the casino train could lead to the closure of some of Atlantic City’s casinos.</p>
<p>While it’s too early to say for sure what impact the closure of the casino train will have on Atlantic City’s gaming industry, it’s clear that this development is not good news for the city. If revenues continue to decline, it’s possible that we could see some of Atlantic City’s casinos close their doors permanently.</p>

<p>ATLANTIC CITY – Rail leaders are optimistic that a new train casino will be a big winner for the city and its transit system.</p>
<p>The Casino Train operated by NJ Transit began making the run from Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station to Atlantic City on Dec. 27. The train offers passengers a chance to gamble at one of three casinos in the city – Borgata, Caesars and Tropicana.</p>
<p>NJ Transit Executive Director Steve Santoro said he expects the Casino Train to attract about 1 million riders in its first year of operation. That would amount to a significant increase in ridership on the Atlantic City line, which now has 2.5 million riders annually, Santoro said.</p>
<p>“Atlantic City is an important destination for us,” Santoro said. “We see this as not only good for the casinos and their customers, but also for our customer base.”</p>
<p>Donald Trump, who is now president-elect, once owned three casinos in Atlantic City, including Trump Taj Mahal, which closed in October after losing more than $100 million over two years. Casino Train service could help revive business at some of the casinos Trump once owned. But experts say it’s too early to tell if Casino Train service has had a positive or negative effect on Atlantic City gambling revenue so far this year.</p>

NJ Transit has proposed turning Penn Station into a casino in an effort to raise money for the ailing rail system.</p>
<p>The proposal was met with criticism by some who feel that the casino would only further congest the already busy station. Others argue that it would be a welcomed addition to the area, bringing jobs and economic growth.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no decision made on whether or not to move forward with the casino plan. In the meantime, commuters are left to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.</p>
