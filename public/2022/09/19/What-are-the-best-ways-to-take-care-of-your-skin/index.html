<h1 id="How-do-I-get-rid-of-dry-skin"><a href="#How-do-I-get-rid-of-dry-skin" class="headerlink" title="How do I get rid of dry skin?"></a>How do I get rid of dry skin?</h1><p>Dry skin is a common problem that can occur year-round or seasonally, depending on your climate. Many factors can contribute to dry skin, such as the weather, your bathing habits, and the products you use on your skin.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are many ways to treat dry skin. The first step is to identify and eliminate the factors that are causing it. Then, you can use a variety of methods to moisturize and protect your skin.</p>
<p>If you have dry skin, here are six tips to help you get rid of it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify and avoid the triggers.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step in treating dry skin is identifying and avoiding the triggers that cause it. Some of the most common triggers include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bathing too often or using hot water</li>
<li>Soaps, detergents, and other harsh chemicals</li>
<li>Alcohol-based products</li>
<li>Air conditioning or heating</li>
<li>Windy weather</li>
<li>Taking long baths or showers</li>
<li>Sun exposure</li>
<li>Excessive sweating</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Eating spicy foods<br>Once you know what causes your dry skin, you can take steps to avoid them. For example, if hot water or air conditioning aggravates your skin, try taking cooler baths or showers and using a humidifier in your home during the winter months. If windy weather is a problem, try wearing a scarf or hat when you go outside. And if spicy foods are the issue, try avoiding them or eating them in moderation.</li>
<li>Drink plenty of water .<br>Water is essential for overall health and well-being, including healthy skin! dehydration can lead to dry skin, so make sure you drink plenty of water each day – at least eight cups per day.. In addition to drinking water, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables which are also high in water content.. This will help keep your body hydrated from the inside out!<br>3 Apply moisturizer immediately after bathing .</li>
</ol>
<p>When you bathe or shower, the warm water opens up your pores and strips away sebum – the natural oil that protects your skin from drying out . To prevent your skin from becoming dry post-bath&#x2F;shower , apply moisturizer within three minutes of getting out of the shower while your pores are still open .. You could also try applying a moisturizer before bathing if you have really dry skin .. Be sure to apply sunscreen when going outside afterwards as many moisturizers do not contain sunscreen ..  </p>
<p>4 Avoid using harsh soaps .</p>
<p>Harsh soaps can strip away sebum and natural oils from your skin leading to dryness . Instead , opt for milder soaps such as Dove , Cetaphil , Basis , Purpose , Oilatum , Aquaphor , Eucerin .. These brands have been designed for people with sensitive skin and will not aggravate dryness . If you cannot find any of these brands locally , look for them online ..   5 Skip alcohol-based products .</p>
<p>Alcohol-based products such as toners , astringents , cleansers … etc., can be very drying for the skin . In some cases they can even strip away all oils from the surface of the skin leading to redness and irritation .. Look for alcohol-free alternatives instead ..   6 Use a humidifier in winter months .</p>
<p>Heating systems in cold climates tend to suck all the moisture out of indoor air which can lead to dryness in both hair and skin .. A humidifier will add moisture back into the air and help reduce problems with dehydration ..</p>
